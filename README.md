## Treasure Hunt App - JUMPSTART --Momento only 

## Introduction

This was my very first project ever during Jumpstart Weekend at LEARN Academy.  I have since reworked the project using React, but I decided to keep this original repo here to remind myself how far I have come from then to now. 

## Features

The INTENDED feature was for the user to be able to play a treasure hunt game, sadly, with the time we had at jumpstart, my partner and I did not complete the project.  Again, I have since reworked the project to completion using React, this repo is only meant as a momento.  

## Dependencies

Node Package Manager

npm install
